It would be useful to have a basic understanding of which source files are generated by **Nox.Generator** based on the solution we've defined.

> ðŸ’¡ Learn more about .NET source generators and how they're implemented by reading [this article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/source-generators-overview).

In a code editor that enables you to view generated source code, like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/), collapse the Dependencies > Analyzers > Nox.Generator > Nox.Generator.NoxCodeGenerator tree under the Solution Explorer tab.

You'll be presented with the full list of source files that the **Nox.Generator** has generated. The first file of interest that we'll look at is `0.Generator.g.cs`. This files gives us an overview of the generator process and whether it was successfull or not.

Viewing the file in the code editor confirms that it found 2 files, our Nox solution file `Cryptocash.solution.nox.yaml` as well as the single entity which we've defined at this stage `Currency.entity.nox.yaml`.

The first section of the file name denotes which section of the Nox solution the generated source file pertains to. In our sample application we files pertaining to Application, Domain, Infrastructure and Presentation.

### Domain

As per the Visual Studio screenshot below, you'll notice that 2 Domain source files have been generated. The source for both files originate from the entity file we've defined as part of our Nox solution, in this instance `Currency.entity.nox.yaml`.

`Domain.currency.g.cs` is the actual class definition of Currency. You might notice that it's a partial class, that allows us to extend it at will.

`Domain.Meta.currency.g.cs` is also a partial class extension of Currency, in this instance used to facilitate Nox behaviour like dealing with unique keys, assigning certain properties to attributes or invoking behaviour related to instantiating a specific Nox.Type.

</div>

Each entity you define as part of your solution will have these files generated.

### Application: DTOs

This section includes, but are not limited to, Commands, Queries, DTOs, Factories and application extensions. Let's start by looking at the generated DTOs.

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://noxorg.dev/docs/images/visual-studio_sample-nox-generator2-dto.png" alt="Overview" width="100%">
    <br>
</div>

Notice the 3 DTOs that have been generated for our `Currency` entity:
- The primary `Application.Dto.CurrencyDto.g.cs` which echoes our entity definition and generated class definition
- The 'Create' DTO `Application.Dto.CurrencyCreateDto.g.cs` which is used for all create (POST) endpoints.
- The 'Update' DTO `Application.Dto.CurrencyUpdateDto.g.cs` which is used for all update (PUT/PATCH) endpoints.

The DTOs implement additional error messages extrapolated from attribute properties as well as, in the case of the Create DTO, a method to covert the DTO to an entity.

### Application: Commands

Looking at the generated `Application.Commands.[command_name]` files, you'll notice that 4 source files have been generated for our `Currency` entity, corresponding with all the update endpoints: 

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://noxorg.dev/docs/images/visual-studio_sample-nox-generator2-command.png" alt="Overview" width="100%">
    <br>
</div>

- `Application.Commands.CreateCurrencyCommand.g.cs` to create (POST) a new currency.
- `Application.Commands.DeleteCurrencyByIdCommand.g.cs` to delete (DELETE) a currency with the required ID.
- `Application.Commands.UpdateCurrencyCommand.g.cs` to update (PUT) a currency.
- `Application.Commands.PartialUpdateCurrencyCommand.g.cs` to affect a partial update (PATCH) on a currency.

### Application: Queries

Looking at the generated `Application.Queries.[query_name]` files, you'll notice that 2 source files have been generated for our `Currency` entity, corresponding with both default read endpoints: 

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://noxorg.dev/docs/images/visual-studio_sample-nox-generator2-query.png" alt="Overview" width="100%">
    <br>
</div>

- `Application.Queries.GetCurrenciesQuery.g.cs` retrieve (GET) a list of currencies.
- `Application.Queries.GetCurrencyByIdQuery.g.cs` retrieve (GET) a currency matching the supplied ID.

### Infrastructure

You'll notice 2 generated Infrastructure files, both related to Persistence. These files are the result of the database settings that we defined in our Nox solution file under the `infrastructure > persistence > databaseServer` node.

The Nox.Generator has created both `CryptocashDbContext` which extends `DbContext` as well as a `DtoDbContext` which can be used throughout our solution when we add any custom code.

    <br>
</div>

### Presentation

The generated source files prefixed with `Presentation.Api.[name]` applies to OData extension methods as well as the default OData controllers.

`Presentation.Api.OData.CurrenciesController.g.cs` is the default OData controller generated for our `Currency` entity. It contains all the expected endpoints, `Get` with `GetById` overload, `Post`, `Put`, `Patch` and `Delete`.

All the update methods called from these endpoints can be found in the respective `Application.Commands.[action].g.cs` generated files mentioned earlier.

`Presentation.Api.OData.ODataServiceCollectionExtensions.g.cs` contains additional logic to register additional OData models or functions with the Nox runtime library.

### Conclusion

The aim of this section was in no way to provide a definitive overview of the Nox.Generator, but rather to provide an introduction as to how you can start peeking under the hood of what Nox is doing.

It will also aim us in understanding where our source material lies when we start extending the Nox solution with our own custom code.
