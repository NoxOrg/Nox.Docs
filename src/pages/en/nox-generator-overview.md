It would be useful to have a basic understanding of which source files are generated by **Nox.Generator** based on the solution we've defined.

> ðŸ’¡ Learn more about .NET source generators and how they're implemented by reading [this article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/source-generators-overview).

In a code editor that enables you to view generated source code, like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/), collapse the Dependencies > Analyzers > Nox.Generator > Nox.Generator.NoxCodeGenerator tree under the Solution Explorer tab.

You'll be presented with the full list of source files that the **Nox.Generator** has generated. The first file of interest that we'll look at is `0.Generator.g.cs`. This files gives us an overview of the generator process and whether it was successfull or not.

Viewing the file in the code editor confirms that it found 2 files, our Nox solution file `Cryptocash.solution.nox.yaml` as well as the single entity which we've defined at this stage `Currency.entity.nox.yaml`.

The first section of the file name denotes which section of the Nox solution the generated source file pertains to. In our sample application we files pertaining to Application, Domain, Infrastructure and Presentation.

### Domain

As per the Visual Studio screenshot below, you'll notice that 2 Domain source files have been generated. The source for both files originate from the entity file we've defined as part of our Nox solution, in this instance `Currency.entity.nox.yaml`.

`Domain.currency.g.cs` is the actual class definition of Currency. You might notice that it's a partial class, that allows us to extend it at will.

`Domain.Meta.currency.g.cs` is also a partial class extension of Currency, in this instance used to facilitate Nox behaviour like dealing with unique keys, assigning certain properties to attributes or invoking behaviour related to instantiating a specific Nox.Type.

Each entity you define as part of your solution will have these files generated.

### Application: DTOs

This section includes, but are not limited to, Commands, Queries, DTOs, Factories and application extensions. Let's start by looking at the generated DTOs.

    <br>
</div>

Notice the 3 DTOs that have been generated for our `Currency` entity:
- The primary `Application.Dto.CurrencyDto.g.cs` which echoes our entity definition and generated class definition
- The 'Create' DTO `Application.Dto.CurrencyCreateDto.g.cs` which is used for all create (POST) endpoints.
- The 'Update' DTO `Application.Dto.CurrencyUpdateDto.g.cs` which is used for all update (PUT/PATCH) endpoints.

The DTOs implement additional error messages extrapolated from attribute properties as well as, in the case of the Create DTO, a method to covert the DTO to an entity.

### Application: Commands

Looking at the generated Command source files, you'll notice classes to for all the update actions:

    <br>
</div>

4 Command classes have been generated for our `Currency` entity:
- The primary `Application.Commands.CreateCurrencyCommand.g.cs` which echoes our entity definition and generated class definition
- The 'Create' DTO `Application.Commands.DeleteCurrencyByIdCommand.g.cs` which is used for all create (DELETE) endpoints.
- The 'Update' DTO `Application.Commands.UpdateCurrencyCommand.g.cs` which is used for all update (PUT) endpoints.
- The 'Update' DTO `Application.Commands.PartialUpdateCurrencyCommand.g.cs` which is used for all update (PATCH) endpoints.
