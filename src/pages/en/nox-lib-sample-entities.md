Let's add Country and Exchange Rate entities to our solution next. We'll simply add new entity defintion files to our ```./Design``` folder.

### Add Country entity

Add a new ```./Design/Country``` folder and create the ```Country.entity.nox.yaml``` file.

> ðŸ’¡ We'll take this opportunity to add some additional country-related info fields that will prove useful for our Currency Exchange solution later.

```yaml
#
# Country.entity.nox.yaml
#

name: Country
description: Countries and related data
pluralName: Countries
table: Country
schema: dbo

relatedParents: [Currency]
    
attributes:

  - name: Id

    canSort: true

  - name: Name

```

### Add Exchange Rate

Add a new ```./Design/ExchangeRate``` folder and create the ```ExchangeRate.entity.nox.yaml``` file.

```yaml
#
# ExchangeRate.entity.nox.yaml
#

name: ExchangeRate

description: The exchange rate at a piont in time vs CHF (reference currency)

relatedParents: [Currency]

attributes:

  - name: Id
    description: The unique identifier of an exchange rate
    isPrimaryKey: true
    type: int
    canFilter: true
    canSort: true

  - name: AsAt
    description: The date and time at which the rate changed
    type: datetime

  - name: Rate
    description: The exchange rate relative to Swiss Franc (CHF)
    type: decimal
    maxWidth: 14
    precision: 8
```
### Add migrations and update database

Let's add migrations and update the database to include our new ```Country``` and ```ExchangeRate``` tables

```powershell
dotnet ef migrations add AddCountryExchangeRate --context NoxDbContext
dotnet ef database update --context NoxDbContext
```
Your solution ```./Design``` folder should look like the graphic below now, and the new migrations have been added to the ```./Migrations``` folder:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://noxorg.dev/docs/images/vscode_design-folder-add-entities.png" alt="Overview" width="100%">
    <br>
</div>

And reviewing the ```SampleCurrencyDb``` in your database utitily of choice will confirm that the ```Country``` and ```ExchangeRate``` tables have been added.

    <br>
</div>

### A note on data relations and foreign keys

The eagle-eyed among you may have noticed that when we declared our ```Country``` and ```CurrencyExchange``` entities, we used the ```relatedParents``` property to specify a relation to the ```Currency``` entity.

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://noxorg.dev/docs/images/vscode_sample-related-parents.png" alt="Overview" width="100%">
    <br>
</div>

And if we expand the ER diagram of our ```Country``` and ```ExchangeRate``` tables, we will notice that the Nox library have scaffolded our database relations as well as foreign keys and indexes.

    <br>

Next we'll move on to the exciting part, let's [source and import some data into our solution](./nox-lib-sample-seed-data).
