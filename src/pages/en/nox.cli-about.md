***
Nox.Cli is a companion command-line tool that supports the core [Nox library](https://github.com/NoxOrg/Nox). Its *raison d'Ãªtre* is to build upon Nox's strong efficiency focus by extending that vision to the entire Enterprise Software Roadmap. This includes fast-tracking of DevOps functions like deployment to multiple environments, setting up CI/CD pipelines and configuring resource permissions. This is achieved by integrating seamlessly with existing enterprise assets and services like Helm charts, Azure KeyVault and Active Directory.

Nox.Cli is declarative in nature with the primary aim of describing a project or solution. It uses a range of plugin technologies in the development, infrastructure and DevOps realms to rapidly configure and deploy a solution in the enterprise.
