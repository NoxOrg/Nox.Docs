### Introduction

[Nox.Types](https://github.com/NoxOrg/Nox.Types) is a Domain driven type system for Nox solutions

An important principal of Nox is that it should allow the solution to be broadly designed/specified by domain expert or business analyst rather than architects and developers.

One of the key aims of Nox is that it should allow for the broad definition of the domain to be achieved by a domain expert or business analyst.

It should also reduce-or ideally eliminate- the intervention by a technical resouce like an architect or developer to translate that definition before the implementation of a domain model

THe YAML configuration properties of a typical solution aids in this goal, but often a further level of abstraction is required to ease this definition.

Nox implements a collection of role-agnostic value objects that are language friendly and easily interpreted. universally recognised.

When it comes to defining entities, Nox takes the approach of using value objects rather than primitive data types.

It's useful to abstract primitive data types and persistence considerations in a domain environment where business (rather than technical) specialists can define domain entities.

There is an additional mapping layer that deals with persisted to the various database primitive types.
